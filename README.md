## Need Help?
If you have questions, please ask!  Office hours are open time for students
to get help -- please join if you have questions.

## COVID
While the goal for this semester is to be as normal as possilbe,
with COVID there will still likely be
surprises and we will need to be flexible to accommodate changes.

I recognize the difficulties some of you may face.
My goal is to make this semester as effective and as smooth
as possible.  Please reach out to me early and keep me informed
of any issues that arise.

### Course Schedule
This table outlines the entire course schedule.  Lecture notes are
posted for each topic.  Lecture videos, although not direct recordings
of this semester's live lectures, cover the same topics and are beneficial
if you are sick or do not feel comfortable attending in person.
Minilab links will be added prior to the start of class.  The dates in this
schedule are tentative and subject to change.
